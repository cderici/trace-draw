- scrolling on the right side panel is very inefficient
- highlighting is bit wonky
- reuse the labels extracted in the pre-process phase

- DONE relativize the mouse position checks to find traces (scaling/scrolling is messing it up right now)
- DONE set the total width/height based on trace/bridge numbers
- DONE get the use counts of traces and draw them ordered
- DONE show all the traces (with inner loops)
- DONE show all the bridges
- DONE connect who jumps to where with lines/curves
- DONE make all the traces and bridges be found by mouse position
- DONE click on a trace to open a window with all the trace codes

-for implementation-

- improve the pick-bridges-for in private/process to process all depth levels (not just the first two) (for the bridges guard-exiting to other bridges)
- separate the traces and bridge-guard-ids in hilites
