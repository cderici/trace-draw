- set the total width/height based on trace/bridge numbers
- get the use counts of traces and draw them ordered
- scrolling on the right side panel is very inefficient
- highlighting is bit wonky

- DONE show all the traces (with inner loops)
- DONE show all the bridges
- DONE connect who jumps to where with lines/curves
- DONE make all the traces and bridges be found by mouse position
- DONE click on a trace to open a window with all the trace codes

-for implementation-

- separate the traces and bridge-guard-ids in hilites
