- add a functionality to say "highlight getfields", "highlight setfields" or "hide guards" etc.

----------------- long term

- make it able to compare two separate traces side by side (i.e. open two trace files at once)

----------------- for implementation-

- reuse the labels extracted in the pre-process phase
- improve the pick-bridges-for in private/process to process all depth levels (not just the first two) (for the bridges guard-exiting to other bridges)
- separate the traces and bridge-guard-ids in hilites

----------------- DONE

- DONE highlighting is bit wonky
- DONE scrolling on the right side panel is very inefficient
- DONE relativize the mouse position checks to find traces (scaling/scrolling is messing it up right now)
- DONE set the total width/height based on trace/bridge numbers
- DONE get the use counts of traces and draw them ordered
- DONE show all the traces (with inner loops)
- DONE show all the bridges
- DONE connect who jumps to where with lines/curves
- DONE make all the traces and bridges be found by mouse position
- DONE click on a trace to open a window with all the trace codes
