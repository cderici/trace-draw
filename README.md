This is a racket/gui tool to visually inspect the trace logs generated by an RPython JIT with `PYPYLOG=jit-log-opt:log-file <binary>`

Use it from the command line:

    $ racket main.rkt <trace-log-file>

You can use the given `demo.trace` file to see how it works:

    $ racket main.rkt demo.trace

You can also use the given `demo-big.trace` file (~12M) to see how it behaves with big trace files:

    $ racket main.rkt demo-big.trace

Using the big file will also allow you to see the loading screen as well (it will be replaced with the main gui after loading):

Here's how the main gui looks like after loading:
