This is a racket/gui tool to visually inspect the trace logs generated by an RPython JIT with `PYPYLOG=jit-log-opt:log-file <binary>`

Use it from the command line:

    $ racket main.rkt <trace-log-file>

You can use the given `demo.trace` file to see how it works:

    $ racket main.rkt demo.trace
